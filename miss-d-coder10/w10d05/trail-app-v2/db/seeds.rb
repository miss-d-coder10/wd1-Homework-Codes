# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("TRUNCATE trails RESTART IDENTITY")
#
# Trail.create!([{
#   name: "Pacific Crest Trail",
#   distance: 2659,
#   conditions: "expert"
# },{
#   name: "Appalachian Trail",
#   distance: 2200,
#   conditions: "expert"
# },{
#   name: "Continental Divide Trail",
#   distance: 3100,
#   conditions: "expert"
# }])
#
# Country.create!([{
#   name: "USA - Canada",
